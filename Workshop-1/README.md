## Project Introduction
### Context and Justification
TEND emerges as a response to the need for digital tools to manage mental health, offering a safe space for tracking emotional states, daily habits, and personal reflections.

### Project Objectives
- Design an intuitive mobile application for emotional tracking.  
- Implement a recommendation system based on behavioral patterns.  
- Facilitate connections with certified mental health professionals.  
- Ensure privacy and security of sensitive data.

## Development Methodology
The project was organized into four main phases:

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- **Functional:** 8 categories, from user registration to communication with professionals.  
- **Non-Functional:** security, usability, and performance (e.g., response time under 2 seconds).  

### Phase 2: User Stories
Six stories were developed, including: secure registration, personalized reminders, personal diary, emotion tracking, communication with professionals, and experience personalization. Each story included verifiable acceptance criteria.  

### Phase 3: User Interface Design
Mockups were created for:  
- Authentication screen (login/registration).  
- Main interface with calendar and emotion color coding.  
- Modules for emotion, sleep, and nutrition tracking.  
- Analysis panel with trends and recommendations.  

### Phase 4: Object-Oriented Design
Using CRC cards, the main classes were defined:  
- **User:** authentication and profile management.  
- **EmotionManager:** emotion tracking.  
- **PersonalDiary:** diary entry management.  
- **RecommendationEngine:** personalized suggestions.  
- **StatisticsManager:** analysis and reports.  
- **ProfessionalCommunication:** connection with specialists.

## System Architecture
- **Applied Patterns:** MVC, Singleton, Observer.  
- **Data Flow:** layered architecture (presentation, business logic, persistence).  

---

## Results and Deliverables
- Functional and non-functional requirements document.  
- User stories with acceptance criteria.  
- Interface prototypes (mockups).  
- CRC cards.  
- Final project presentation.  

**Project Innovations:**  
- Color-coded emotional tracking system.  
- Behavior-based recommendation engine.  
- Ethical handling of sensitive data.  
- Integration with certified professionals.
