# TEND The Mental Health Assistant – Project  
TEND emerges as a response to the need for digital tools to manage mental health, offering a safe space for tracking emotional states, daily habits, and personal reflections.
This project compiles the work carried out for the design of the *Mental Health Assistant* application, an app focused on supporting users in managing their emotional well-being and facilitating connections with certified professionals.  

The consolidated document presents, step by step, how the idea evolved — from identifying the problems to be solved to the object-oriented design proposal.

## Development Process  

The project was developed in four main phases, each corresponding to a section:  

### 1. Requirements  
The project began with defining requirements, separated into two types:  

- **Functional Requirements (FRs):** specify what the app must do. Main features include:  
  - Secure sign-up and login.  
  - Emotional calendar with daily color tracking.  
  - Personal journal for reflections and gratitude notes.  
  - Personalized reminders and notifications.  
  - Graphical statistics and progress reports.  
  - Recommended actions based on user data.  
  - Communication with verified health centers, always under user consent.  

- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** ensure quality and reliability. Key aspects:  
  - **Security and privacy:** encryption, secure authentication, sensitive data control.  
  - **Usability:** intuitive, calming, and accessible interface.  
  - **Availability and reliability:** stable system, 24/7 uptime, data backup.  
  - **Cross-platform compatibility:** Android, iOS, and scalable to web.  
  - **Performance:** response times under 2 seconds for registrations and queries.  
  - **Ethics and trust:** no automated diagnoses; crisis-support mechanisms included.  

### 2. User Stories  
Based on the requirements, user stories were written to reflect real needs of:  
- **Patients:** seeking support, motivation, and clarity in their habits.  
- **Professionals:** needing access to prior summaries, saving time in first consultations, and reaching the right clients.  

Each story included acceptance criteria, ensuring that functionalities could be validated objectively.  

### 3. Mockups  
Visual prototypes were created to represent the user experience and showcase key screens, such as:  
- User registration.  
- Emotional calendar with color coding.  
- Mood and habit tracking.  
- Visualization of statistics and reports.  

These mockups helped validate the user flow and confirm alignment with identified needs.  

### 4. CRC Cards  
Finally, CRC Cards (Class–Responsibility–Collaboration) were prepared to define:  
- Main system classes (e.g., User, Journal, Statistics, Recommendations, HealthCenter).  
- Their specific responsibilities and collaborators.  

This step translated requirements into a preliminary object-oriented architecture, essential for future technical development.  

## Document Objective  
The purpose of this work is to consolidate in one file the key elements of the app’s design:  
- Provide a complete overview of the system, from problem definition to the proposed technical solution.  
- Serve as reference material for review, presentation, and future implementation.  
- Demonstrate a structured process of software analysis and design, following best engineering practices.
